# Changelog

All notable changes to the MIRAGE pipeline will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`nuclear_markers`** parameter (default `['DAPI', 'CELLTOX']`) — an ordered preference list
  naming the nuclear/fiducial channel. The first marker present (resolved from channel metadata,
  never the filename) is moved to channel 0 by `CONVERT_IMAGE`. Fails fast if none is present
  (single-channel images excepted).

### Changed
- **The registration method's intrinsic TRE is no longer named after VALIS.** Both backends
  estimate a target registration error from their own registration — VALIS a feature-distance
  `*_summary.csv`, STARE a `*_tre.json` — but the QC pipeline called the slot `valis_summary`
  end to end. It is now `registration_tre`: the adapters emit `intrinsic_tre`, `REGISTRATION`
  emits `registration_tre`, and that is the artifact kind `FINAL_QC` recognises.
  **Published-output change:** the folder inside the `qc/mirage_qc_data_*/` report bundle that
  holds these raw artifacts is renamed `valis_summary/` -> `registration_tre/`. Nothing else
  about the published tree changes — no path, filename or checkpoint-CSV column moves.
  `GENERATE_QC_REPORT`'s `--valis-summary` flag is likewise now `--registration-tre` (an
  internal process-to-script interface; the parameter surface is unchanged).
- **`nuclear_markers` is now honoured by every consumer**, not only `CONVERT_IMAGE`:
  `SPLIT_CHANNELS`/`split_multichannel.py`, `SEGMENT`, `SEG_QC_GEOJSON`, and `CsvUtils`'
  samplesheet validation and channel counting all resolve the nuclear/fiducial channel from the
  same rule now, so it genuinely drives both cell segmentation and the registration fiducial.
  **Behaviour change under the shipped default `['DAPI', 'CELLTOX']`:** a samplesheet with a
  channel whose name *contains* `CELLTOX` (case-insensitive) now has that channel dropped from
  non-reference slides, exactly as `DAPI` always was. On an affected run, `add_cycle`'s
  double-written `merged_quant.csv` becomes a single correct file, and the redundant per-cycle
  fiducial disappears from `*_quant.csv`. Users who want the old behaviour should set
  `--nuclear_markers DAPI`.
- **`--nuclear_markers` now accepts a comma/space-separated string as well as a list**, so
  `--nuclear_markers CELLTOX` works on the command line (`nextflow_schema.json` type widened to
  `["array", "string"]`).
- **`reg_micro_reg` now defaults to `2`** (maximum: micro-rigid + micro non-rigid), previously `0`.
  Registrations run the full micro-registration by default — a quality-over-speed change
  (micro-registration can add ~30–120 min per registration).
- **`--seg_method` with an unrecognised value now fails fast** instead of silently running
  StarDist.
- **`<outdir>/size_logs/versions.yml`'s single key changed** to
  `MIRAGE:FINAL_QC:AGGREGATE_SIZE_LOGS` (diagnostic string only; no functional effect).

### Removed
- **`reg_reference_markers`** — removed. It only fed a filename-based fallback for reference-image
  selection that the pipeline never reached (the reference slide is chosen by `is_reference`, and
  `--reference` is always passed to VALIS). Nuclear-channel selection is now `nuclear_markers`
  (metadata-based). `register.py`'s standalone `--reference-markers` CLI flag is unaffected.
- **`padding` / `pad_mode`** and the `PAD_IMAGES`, `GET_IMAGE_DIMS`, and `MAX_DIM` processes —
  removed. Padding was default-off and unused: both registration backends align inputs of differing
  sizes natively (VALIS into a shared space; the tiled/STARE backend into the reference's shape).
  This also removed the pipeline's only filename-based channel-name inference.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-29

First public release. End-to-end multiplex WSI processing: preprocessing, registration,
segmentation, per-cell quantification, optional phenotyping, and QuPath-compatible
GeoJSON + pyramidal OME-TIFF export.

### Added
- **Preprocessing** — BaSiC illumination correction with FOV tiling; Bio-Formats/ND2 →
  OME-TIFF conversion; multi-channel parallel processing.
- **Registration** — two backends selected by `--registration_method`:
  - `valis` (default): VALIS graph-based whole-slide alignment, with optional staged
    micro-registration (`reg_micro_reg` = 0/1/2).
  - `tiled`: STARE — JVM-free, internally tiled, fully parallel registration
    (`reg_tiled_*` params), usable on a laptop.
- **Staged registration QC** (`reg_qc` = 0/1/2) — DAPI overlay plus segmentation-overlap
  dice/displacement attributed per registration stage.
- **Segmentation** — three backends via `--seg_method`: StarDist (default), InstanSeg,
  and CellSAM; GPU or CPU; configurable nuclei→whole-cell expansion.
- **Quantification** — per-cell morphology and per-channel intensity; optional
  per-compartment (Nucleus / Cytoplasm / Cell) signal and expanded Mean/Sum statistics.
- **Phenotyping (optional, panel-agnostic)** — conformal-risk-controlled cell-type
  assignment when a panel is supplied (`panel_spec` / `panel_model`); skipped by default.
- **Reference-free segmentation-quality evaluation** — CellSegmentationEvaluator
  `QualityScore` with a `cse_max_pixels` downsample cap.
- **Export** — QuPath-compatible `cells.geojson` and pyramidal OME-TIFF; configurable
  contour simplification (`simplify_tolerance`) and coordinate precision.
- **Incremental cyclic-IF** (`--mode add_cycle`) — fold a new imaging cycle into a
  completed patient run, reusing the prior reference, segmentation mask, and old-marker
  quantification; recomputes only the new cycle.

### Infrastructure
- DSL2 Nextflow architecture with step-based execution (`--start` / `--stop`).
- Checkpoint-based restart (preprocessing, registration, postprocessing).
- SLURM/Singularity and Docker execution profiles.
- Per-process version tracking, aggregated QC report, and computational-resource report.
- JSON-schema parameter definitions plus Groovy validation utilities.
