"""MERGE_AND_PYRAMID must build the published pyramid without ever holding the slide.

``bin/merge_channels_pyramid.py`` used to run three passes: scan metadata, allocate the
whole ``(C, H, W)`` output stack and fill it channel by channel, then hand that array to
``tifffile`` and derive each pyramid level from the previous one -- holding both, plus
``downsample_image``'s per-channel float32 temporary, plus the slide-sized uint32 mask
stack. ``conf/modules.config`` asked for 200-300 GB and the process still hit a node-memory
cliff in production.

It now streams: the base resolution is written from a generator of tiles fed by
``open_lazy`` row-band reads, each pyramid level is derived one channel at a time and tiled
only on the way out, and the mask series streams the same way.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS, AND WHY EACH ASSERTION IS THE ONE THAT CATCHES THE MISTAKE:

1. **Every level is pixel-identical to the whole-array derivation.** The reference below is
   the pre-streaming writer reproduced verbatim, INCLUDING its own inline
   ``cv2.resize(plane.astype(float32), INTER_AREA)`` rather than a call into the module
   under test -- so a bug inside the factored-out ``_downsample_plane_f32`` cannot be
   reproduced identically on both sides and cancel out. The comparison is
   ``np.array_equal`` per level, and the files are additionally compared BYTE FOR BYTE with
   only tifffile's random per-file UUID masked out, which catches metadata and IFD-layout
   drift that a pixel comparison would not.

2. **An ODD-DIMENSIONED fixture.** This is the case that separates a correct implementation
   from a plausible one, and an even-only fixture set proves nothing about it --
   see ``test_band_wise_downsampling_is_not_whole_plane_downsampling`` for the measured
   trap, and ``_downsample_plane_f32``'s docstring for why it forecloses the obvious
   "derive the levels as the base streams" design.

3. **Bands are forced small** (``READ_BAND_BYTES`` monkeypatched) in the equality tests.
   At the shipped 256 MB budget every test-sized image is a single band, so an
   implementation that silently leaked a band boundary into the output would pass a test
   that did not force more than one band.

4. **The peak does not grow with the channel count**, measured with ``tracemalloc``
   -- the property ``conf/modules.config``'s memory closure is derived from.

5. **The per-channel validation log is unchanged**: same lines, same numbers, and in
   particular the wrapped-value percentage computed against the WHOLE channel rather than
   against whichever band it was folded from.
