"""containers/images.json is the ONE list of images to build. Keep it honest.

This guards the failure that shipped `:tiled` unpublished: a new build context
appears under containers/, nothing adds it to the build matrix, CI stays green
because nothing references it, and the first run that pulls the tag fails on the
cluster with "manifest unknown" -- long after the change looked done.

The list is also read by the workflow's `only` filter, so a name here that has no
directory produces a dispatch option that always fails.

    Registry-agnostic on purpose: the previous version of this scan hardcoded

    bolt3x/mirage-* it silently matched nothing (referenced == set(), every
    assertion over it vacuously true). This one recognizes bolt3x/mirage-*
    by the naming convention the rename actually produced, not by grepping a
    string that happened to be true on one day.

    Two sources are scanned, not one. `modules/local/*.nf`'s literal
    `container "..."` directives cover most processes, but SEGMENT and
    WARP_SEG_QC resolve their container through a closure --
    `container { SegBackends.container(params.seg_method) }` and
    `container { WarpBackends.container(method) }` -- so the image name never
    appears as a literal string in modules/local/ at all; it lives in
    lib/SegBackends.groovy's and lib/WarpBackends.groovy's per-backend maps.
    Scanning modules/local/ alone would silently miss stardist/instanseg/cellsam
    entirely, and would find `tiled` only by accident (five other, unrelated
    modules happen to reference it directly too).

    Both sources run through `strip_comments` (nfmodel's view that blanks
    comments but keeps string literals intact) rather than
    `strip_comments_and_strings`: a container reference lives INSIDE a string
    literal, and the "and_strings" view blanks exactly that.
