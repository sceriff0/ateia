"""Ruling R6: every base image and every external image is pinned by content digest.

A version TAG is mutable. `python:3.11-slim` is republished weekly, `nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-*`
has been rebuilt against new CUDA patch releases, and even `ubuntu:22.04` moves on every
point release. Rebuilding an image from a mutable tag therefore produces a DIFFERENT image
than the one that generated the published results, with nothing in the repository recording
which one that was. containers/README.md has admitted this in a "Remaining reproducibility
caveat" paragraph since the one-repo-per-image rename; this file is what closes it.

TWO FORMS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE CONTAINER RUNTIME.

  * A Dockerfile `FROM` keeps its tag AND carries the digest --
    `FROM image:tag@sha256:<64 hex>`. BuildKit documents that form and the tag is what
    makes the line readable to a human.
  * A Nextflow `container` directive carries the digest and NO tag --
    `image@sha256:<64 hex>`. Docker accepts either, but Apptainer/Singularity documents
    an image reference as NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST] -- tag OR digest -- and has a history of
    bugs with the combined form. The cluster pulls through Singularity, so these take
    the form both runtimes agree on. The tag lives in the comment beside them.

FIRST-PARTY IMAGES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED. bolt3x/mirage-* digests do not exist
until release.yml has pushed them, so pinning one in modules/local/*.nf is a
chicken-and-egg. Their record is the published-digest column of containers/README.md.
