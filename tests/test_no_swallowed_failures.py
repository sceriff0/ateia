"""Guard: nothing in this repository ends a command with `|| true`.

THE REGISTER, AND WHY IT IS A TEST RATHER THAN A LIST IN A DOCUMENT. The CI redesign
(2026-09-01) enumerated every `|| true` in the tree and gave each a disposition. An
enumeration written once is a snapshot; the next `|| true` is added by someone who
never read it. So the register is enforced here instead, and the file it is enforced
over is discovered rather than listed.

`|| true` is the *visible* way a check passes while proving nothing:
`nf-core lint --dir . || true` ran in CI for months over a command that could not
lint this repository at all (see .nf-core.yml's header for the version-by-version
measurement), and nobody could tell, because the job was green either way.

WHAT WAS DONE WITH THE FIVE THAT EXISTED, so this file reads as a record and not as
a rule with no history:

  * `ci.yml`'s `nf-core lint --dir . || true`  -- the JOB was deleted (Phase 7).
  * `check_profiles_parse.sh`'s
    `[ "$moved" = 1 ] && mv ... || true`       -- rewritten to an `if`. That is the
    classic `A && B || C` trap: the `|| true` was there to stop the `&&` returning 1
    when the file was never moved, and it swallowed a FAILED `mv` at the same time.
  * `resume_check.sh`'s `cached=$(grep -c ... || true)`  -- rewritten `|| cached=0`.
  * `_test-suite.yml`'s `n=$(... | grep -ci ... || true)` -- rewritten `|| n=0`.
    Both of those are the "nonzero means ZERO MATCHES" idiom with the real assertion
    on the next line; nothing was being swallowed, and writing them as the
    assignments they are means no reader has to classify a `|| true` again.
  * `.readthedocs.yaml`'s `git fetch --unshallow || true`  -- rewritten to ask git
    whether the clone is shallow. This one was on NO version of the register: it was
    found by re-running the scan against the tree instead of trusting the list, which
    is the entire reason this file exists.

SCOPE. Every `run:` body in `.github/workflows/**` and `.github/actions/**`
(resolved through `tests/ci_actions.py`, never a private parse), every tracked shell
script, `.readthedocs.yaml`, every Nextflow process `script:`/`stub:` body (via
`tests/nfmodel`, never a private regex), **every `containers/*/Dockerfile`**, and the
`Makefile`.

THE LAST TWO WERE ADDED IN FIX ROUND 1, AND THE OMISSION IS THE POINT. The first
version of this file scanned the four scopes above and stopped -- in the same commit
series that moved build-time verification INTO `RUN` lines across all eleven
Dockerfiles, on the release path. A reviewer appended `RUN echo scope-probe || true`
to `containers/merge/Dockerfile` and a `|| true` recipe line to the `Makefile` and
this file stayed green, 49/4. The file class where the next swallowed failure will
land had just been created by the same work, and the guard could not see it. Both
probes are reproduced in `test_the_scan_covers_the_build_files` below, so the gap
cannot silently reopen.

COMMENT-BLIND, in the direction that matters. Comments here can only make the scan
report MORE, never less -- a `#` line explaining a removed `|| true` necessarily
quotes it -- so they are stripped, including trailing ones, and the docstring above
is why: this file's own prose would otherwise fail it.
