"""The format suite must run the reader stack CONVERT_IMAGE actually runs.

requirements/format-tests.txt is a second place a version can be written, which
is exactly what requirements/constraints.txt exists to prevent -- but it cannot
be a constraint file, because containers/convert is a documented exception to
the harmonised set (see that file's header, and
test_container_harmonisation.PINNED_EXCEPTIONS). The next best property is
checkable and checked here: every package named in BOTH files is pinned to the
SAME version, and the packages that make the suite meaningful are present.

The Dockerfile is parsed with test_container_harmonisation's own parser, never
a private regex -- seven guards in this repo once carried seven private parses
of these files and each had a different blind spot.
