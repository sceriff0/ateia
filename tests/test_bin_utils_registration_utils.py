"""bin/utils/registration_utils.py — percentile autoscaling, untested until now.

autoscale is what every registration QC overlay is built from. Two of its
properties are the kind that fail silently: a constant image divides by a zero
range (the overlay comes out black or NaN, and the QC panel still renders), and
percentile clipping rather than min/max is the whole reason one saturated pixel
does not flatten a slide to nothing.
