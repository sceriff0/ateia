"""Groovy/Nextflow source masking, shared by every guard that scans `.nf`/`.groovy` text.

`code_view(path)` returns the file with comment and string CONTENT blanked (offsets
preserved), so a naive `re.search(r"params\\.\\w+", ...)` -- or any other regex scan --
cannot mistake prose in a comment, or a filename substring inside a comment, for real
code. It masks `'...'`, `"..."`, `'''...'''`, triple-double-quoted, slashy `/.../` and
dollar-slashy `$/.../$` string forms, honouring backslash escapes everywhere except
`$/.../$`, where Groovy makes a backslash a literal character. GString interpolation is
deliberately NOT masked -- `${...}` and `$ident` stay verbatim, so their braces still
balance and a read hidden inside an interpolation is still counted.

Extracted from `tests/test_group_key_unwrapped.py`, which was the first guard to need a
scan more thorough than the older `_strip_comments()` in `tests/test_resume_determinism.py`
(comments only, no string masking). See that file's module docstring for the full
rationale -- the bug class this exists to catch, the two safety nets (`_assert_balanced`
and the raw-newline-in-string check), and the documented residual limits of the `/`
slashy-string heuristic. Do not re-derive a second copy of this lexer: import `code_view`
here instead.
