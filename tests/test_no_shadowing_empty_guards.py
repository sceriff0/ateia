"""`ifEmpty { error ... }` erases the failure that actually happened.

A channel fed by upstream processes goes empty for two very different reasons: the input
genuinely had nothing in it, or **something upstream failed**. `ifEmpty` cannot tell them
apart, so an `error` raised from inside it reports the first while the second is what really
occurred.

Measured on Nextflow 26.04.6 with a two-line script -- a failing process whose output feeds
`.ifEmpty { error "..." }`:

  * default `errorStrategy` (terminate): the real error prints, then the `ifEmpty` message
    prints *after* it, so the false diagnosis is the last line the user reads;
  * `errorStrategy 'ignore'` -- **which is what `conf/modules.config` sets** -- the real
    failure is dropped entirely. The whole console output is exit 1 and one wrong sentence.

The second case is total erasure, and it is the case this repo actually runs in. It is not
visible from reading either file alone: it needs `conf/modules.config`'s `'ignore'` branch and
the `ifEmpty` together.

The right place for an emptiness check is up front, where the condition is knowable and cannot
be confused with an abort -- `CsvUtils.validateInputSemantics` already rejects a samplesheet
with no reference row before any process is instantiated.
