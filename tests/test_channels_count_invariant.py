"""`channels_count` dual invariant: emitted-file count == distinct-name count.

lib/Meta.groovy's `finish()` states the rule directly (see the comment above
`meta.channels_count = requirePerPatientCount(...)`):

    The dual invariant: channels_count must equal BOTH the number of
    distinct channel names AND the number of emitted files. One consumer
    .unique()s the list and one does not, so any divergence desynchronises
    a streaming groupTuple(size:) and the run hangs or mis-groups.

`channels_count` is computed once, per patient, by
`lib/CsvUtils.groovy::countChannelsPerPatient`, which sums the per-slide
keep-lists `resolveKeptChannelsPerSlide` returns. It feeds
`groupKey(patient_id, channels_count)` at TWO call sites that read the SAME
number for two different purposes:

  1. `subworkflows/local/quantify_markers.nf`'s `ch_grouped_csvs` grouping
     (the per-marker QUANTIFY CSVs) -- this one `.unique { entry -> entry[0] }`s
     on `[patient_id, marker]` immediately before grouping, so it needs the
     grouping to close at the DISTINCT-NAME count.
  2. `subworkflows/local/quantify_markers.nf`'s shared `groupTiffsByPatient()`
     function -- used by both `postprocess.nf`'s pyramid-channel grouping and
     `add_cycle.nf`'s priority-`groupTuple`-fed grouping -- which has NO
     internal `.unique()` of its own (its callers dedup upstream instead), so
     in the general case it needs the grouping to close at the EMITTED-FILE
     count.

`resolveKeptChannelsPerSlide`'s one-name-per-patient claim rule (each marker
name claimed exactly once, reference first then samplesheet order) is what
collapses these into the SAME number: claiming a name marks it emitted, so
"emitted" and "distinct" can never drift apart -- and `countChannelsPerPatient`
is correct for whichever of the two consumers above is asking, without
needing to know which one it is.

This logic is Groovy-only (`lib/CsvUtils.groovy`, `lib/Meta.groovy`), so it is
only reachable through `tests/lib_probe.nf` -- nf-test's own assertion context
cannot see `lib/` (see that file's header). `tests/lib_probe.nf` pins the
dual invariant already for a duplicate declared ACROSS two slides (one
patient's `CELLTOX` claimed by one slide, re-declared by another); this file
adds and then EXERCISES the case this plan calls out specifically: a
duplicate channel name declared TWICE WITHIN ONE SLIDE's own `channels` cell
(e.g. `DAPI|DAPI|KI67`), which the pre-existing block never constructed.

These tests shell out to `nextflow`, which the pytest CI job does not
install (see tests/test_cleanup_validation.py's identical rationale), so they
skip cleanly there; CI's `nextflow-stub` job runs tests/lib_probe.nf directly,
and tests/lib_probe.nf.test runs it again through nf-test.
