"""`ome_io.detect_reader` is the whole format claim, in one function.

README.md says "any Bio-Formats-compatible format" and bin/convert_image.py's
docstring lists six. Neither statement was checkable: the old
`get_file_format` fell through to "bioio" for EVERY unknown suffix, so a .png,
a .txt or a directory named *.zarr reached BioImage and failed there with a
plugin-installation message that named neither the suffix nor what this
pipeline actually supports.

This file needs no image reader at all -- detect_reader is a suffix table --
which is why it lives in the main suite while every other format test lives in
tests/integration/formats/ behind the convert image's reader stack.

IMPORT CONVENTION. `ome_io` is a bin/utils module and imports its siblings
(`jvm_cache`, `pixel_size`) with a flat `from jvm_cache import ...`, so both
`bin` and `bin/utils` must be on `sys.path` -- matching tests/test_ome_io.py
and tests/test_tiled_io.py, not a plain `from utils import ome_io`.
