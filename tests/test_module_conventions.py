"""Guard against multi-process module files.

CLAUDE.md states an explicit convention: "one process per file in
`modules/local/`". A file that defines more than one `process` block forces
its callers into a two-name `include`, and lets a second process silently
grow inside a module named after the first. This test asserts every
`modules/local/*.nf` file defines exactly one `process`.

Note: this deliberately scans only `modules/local/*.nf`, matching the other
guard tests in this campaign. Widening the scan to `workflows/` or
`subworkflows/` (which don't define `process` blocks under this convention
anyway) is out of scope here.
