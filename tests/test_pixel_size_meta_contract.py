"""Guard: no process may render `params.pixel_size` directly unless it is handed an
image it can resolve `'auto'` from itself.

The CRITICAL defect this guards against: `nextflow.config` ships `pixel_size = 'auto'`,
a string nothing resolves except `PREFLIGHT_SCALE` (subworkflows/local/input_check.nf),
which reads every input image's OME metadata once and injects the resolved NUMBER into
`meta.pixel_size`. A process with no image of its own -- EXPORT_GEOJSON (a CSV),
EXPORT_SPATIALDATA (no pyramid unless `--spatialdata_include_image`), SEG_QUALITY_EVAL
(its own tool never reads scale from `image`, see its script comment), and SEGMENT's
instantseg backend (whose `--pixel-size` is `type=float`, so the literal string 'auto'
fails argparse before the tool ever runs) -- cannot resolve that string itself. Reading
`params.pixel_size` directly there reaches the tool as the literal 'auto' at the shipped
default; reading `meta.pixel_size` gets the number PREFLIGHT_SCALE already resolved.

This is a STATIC guard over the same tests/nfmodel this repo's other Nextflow-source
guards use (see tests/test_nfmodel.py's discovery rule) -- never a private regex over
`.nf`/`conf/modules.config` text.
