"""Make the claims in `docs/figures/*.html` checkable against the pipeline.

Those figures are the supplementary methods explainers -- the artefact a
reviewer reads instead of the source. Until this file existed **nothing parsed
them**, and every drift found while auditing them existed for exactly that
reason: a parameter default that had been changed for a documented reason, a
process renamed, an archived process still drawn as if it ran. All of it looked
fine, because a static HTML page fails no test.

Three claim classes are checked, chosen because a test can actually settle them:

1. **Parameter names.** Every `--<name>` and `params.<name>` a figure writes
   must be declared in `nextflow.config`'s `params {}` block.
2. **Pipeline names.** Two scans, unioned. A ``UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`` token
   anywhere in the figure, and *any* all-caps token written as code
   (``<code>``, ``.nm``, ``.name``) -- the second is what puts single-word
   names like ``REGISTER`` and ``SEGMENT`` under the check. Each must resolve
   to a process, a named workflow/subworkflow, or an aliased include.
3. **Parameter rows.** Every ``<td class="k">`` key inside a ``<table
   class="pr">`` that reads as a parameter key must name a declared parameter.
4. **Parameter defaults.** Every such row must state that parameter's actual
   `nextflow.config` default.

What this does **not** cover, and cannot:

* **Prose.** "VALIS matches with SuperGlue", "the micro pass runs twice" -- a
  claim about behaviour, not about a name or a number. Those are what the
  allow-listed figure below is stale on, and no parser settles them.
* **Numbers that are not parameter defaults.** Measured memory figures, file
  sizes, timings, tier tables written as free text rather than as a `k`/`v`
  row. They are checked by nothing here.
* **Whether a figure is COMPLETE.** A figure that omits a whole stage passes.
* **Diagram topology.** The arrows are SVG; that a name exists says nothing
  about whether it is drawn in the right place.
* **A single-word pipeline name written as bare prose.** `REGISTER` inside
  `<code>` is checked; the same word in a running sentence is not, because a
  figure legitimately writes SEGMENT, REGISTER, INPUT and STEP as English.
  Marking a name as code is the claim this file can hold you to.
* **The VALUE half of a compound parameter row.** A key like `seg_pmin /
  seg_pmax` carries two defaults in one cell (`1.0 / 99.8`). Both NAMES are
  checked for existence; neither value is compared.

The floors in each test are what stop the checks becoming vacuous if the
markup is restyled: a restyle that silently stopped matching would otherwise
turn every assertion below into a loop over an empty list, which is the exact
"a count of zero passes" failure `tests/conftest.py` exists to prevent.
