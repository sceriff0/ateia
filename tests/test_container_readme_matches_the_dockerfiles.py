"""containers/README.md's image table must agree with the Dockerfiles it describes.

Three of its eleven base-image cells were wrong at once on 2026-09-02, and each was wrong
in a way a reader would act on:

  * `cellsam` was documented as pytorch/pytorch:2.3.0-cuda12.1-cudnn8-runtime. The real
    base is 2.6.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime, and the Dockerfile's own header explains why --
    torch 2.6.0 is the first release carrying the CVE-2025-32434 fix, which matters because
    cellSAM downloads model weights and torch.load is on that path. The README documented
    the vulnerable version.
  * `instanseg` was documented as 2.5.1-cuda11.8, and its own Dockerfile LABEL said
    "PyTorch 2.5.1 + CUDA 12.4". Three numbers, two of them wrong, in two places.
  * `merge` was documented with a PyTorch base. It is FROM cdgatenbee/valis-wsi:1.0.0 --
    the same upstream VALIS image REGISTER runs in, which is the whole reason it can share
    that image's libvips build.

BASE IMAGES ARE WHAT THIS FILE CHECKS. They are the one column that can be verified
mechanically, and the one that misled three ways at once. Process lists are corrected by
hand in the same commit and are not machine-checked here: docs/resources.md already carries
a per-image process table, and duplicating that comparison would put two guards on one fact.

THE COMPARISON IS TAG-AND-NAME, DIGEST STRIPPED. Every FROM carries an @sha256: digest
(ruling R6, tests/test_base_images_are_digest_pinned.py). Requiring the README to repeat a
64-character digest in a table cell would make it unreadable AND put the digest in two
places; the published-digest column at the bottom of the README is where digests live.

COMMENT-STRIPPED ON PURPOSE (Verification reality item 7). _from_ref strips full-line `#`
comments before matching FROM, and _mapping_rows only reads lines that actually start with
`|` inside the "## Image mapping" section -- a comment mentioning a stale base image cannot
satisfy either check the way a trailing-comment loophole satisfied other guards in this repo.
