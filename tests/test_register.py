"""Guard: bin/register.py's importable surface is what the tests claim it is.

This file previously imported `merge_first_file`, a function that does not exist
in bin/register.py. The `pytest.importorskip("valis")` above the import meant the
ImportError was never reached: the test skipped on every run and could not fail.
It is replaced by a check that runs WITHOUT valis installed, because
bin/register.py's module-level `from valis import registration` is exactly what
makes the file unimportable in CI.

The real behavioural coverage for register.py's pure helpers lives in
tests/test_register_helpers.py, which AST-extracts them.
