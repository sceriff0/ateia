"""The export fixtures must produce a feature per cell, not an empty collection.

WHAT THIS REPRODUCES. `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`'s header records, as red
cause (2) of the `nf-test --tag real` suite, "the exported GeoJSON carries 0
features against 20 rows in the quantification CSV", and calls it downstream of
cause (1), the empty nuclei mask. It is not downstream of anything. The failing
case is the export_geojson nf-test module's "Should produce valid GeoJSON with
cell features - real" case, whose only inputs are tests/testdata/sample_merged_quant.csv
and tests/testdata/sample_contours.json.

Two fixture defects, both measured by running the module's own script by hand:

  * sample_merged_quant.csv carried `centroid_x`/`centroid_y`.
    bin/export_geojson._iter_rows_positional looks up "x"/"y", gets None for both,
    and every row takes the `pd.isna(x_px)` -> `skipped += 1` branch. 20 rows in,
    0 features out. The correct column list was already written down TWICE in the
    generator that produces the fixture -- sample_morphology.csv's
    morphology_columns, and expected/merged_quant_columns.txt.
  * sample_contours.json wrapped each ring as {"coordinates": [...]}.
    bin/extract_cell_properties.extract_contours -- the real producer -- returns
    str(label) -> [[x, y], ...], and _polygon_geometry uses the value AS the ring.

WHY A PYTEST AND NOT ONLY THE nf-test. The nf-test that catches this is tagged
`real`, and `--tag real` runs on the nightly schedule against the default branch
only -- so on `dev` it runs nowhere at all. This runs in the blocking suite, in
about a second, with no container and no Nextflow.
