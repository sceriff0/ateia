"""Every `bin/` CLI must propagate its `main()` return code to the process exit status.

Nextflow decides a task failed by reading the exit status, and `conf/base.config`'s
`errorStrategy` selects on `task.exitStatus`. A `__main__` block that calls `main()`
and throws the result away therefore reports success for a `main()` that returned 1,
and the run goes green on a task that did not do its job.

Two forms are accepted and both are already common here (11 and 10 files when this
guard was written):

    raise SystemExit(main())
    sys.exit(main())

Two are rejected:

  * a bare ``main()`` -- discards the return code outright.
  * ``exit(main())`` -- ``exit`` is injected into builtins by the ``site`` module and
    is absent under ``python -S`` and in frozen/embedded interpreters. It also reads
    as ``sys.exit`` to a hurried reader while being a different object.

Scope is ``bin/**/*.py`` minus ``bin/utils/cse/``, which is vendored (the same
exclusion ``ruff.toml`` applies) and is held to its upstream style.
