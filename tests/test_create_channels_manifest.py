"""bin/create_channels_manifest.py — the map REGISTER and RegisteredMatch pair on.

This script had no test. Its JSON is filename -> [channel names], and after
phase 04 it is what RegisteredMatch.pair uses to reunite VALIS's registered
outputs with their slide metas by channel signature -- so a manifest that
skipped a file, or recorded its channels in the wrong order, re-pairs one
slide's meta with another slide's pixels. Nothing about that is visible in an
exit code.
