"""SegBackends' ctx.params reads must all be supplied by SEGMENT's ctx construction.

modules/local/segment.nf used to hand SegBackends the WHOLE params map
(`params: params`). Nextflow hashes the free variables a process `script:` block
references, so that bound SEGMENT's task hash to every parameter in the pipeline:
changing only `--pyramid_resolutions` re-ran SEGMENT and everything downstream of
it, defeating `-resume`. SEGMENT now receives a slice, declared by
SegBackends.CTX_PARAM_KEYS and applied in subworkflows/local/segmentation.nf.

The cost of that fix is a silent failure mode. `ctx.params.some_new_key` on a map
that does not carry the key yields NULL, not an error -- the backend would build a
command with an empty flag and the run would go green with wrong arguments. This
test is what makes the "add the key in both places" comment enforceable rather
than aspirational.
