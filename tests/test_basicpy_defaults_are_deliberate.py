"""The vendored nf-core BASICPY module, and the decision to run it at UPSTREAM DEFAULTS.

Two separate things are pinned here, both of which are decisions a maintainer could undo
by accident:

1. **`modules/nf-core/basicpy/` is vendored unmodified.** Its container tag, its hardcoded
   version literal and its conda refusal are upstream's, not mirage's. If someone patches
   the module, the copy stops being "the nf-core module" and its MIRAGE-NOTES.md stops
   being true.

2. **`ext.args` is empty on purpose.** mirage's previous in-process call was
   `BaSiC(get_darkfield=True, smoothness_flatfield=1)`; the ruling is to run upstream's
   defaults instead and NOT to reproduce those parameters. That is a decision, so it is
   pinned, because the shape of it -- an empty string in a config file -- looks exactly
   like an oversight to the next reader.

   Two flags in particular must not come back:

   * `--darkfield`. Adding it restores an additive darkfield model that the shipped
     configuration deliberately does not have. That is a change to the correction, not a
     tuning knob -- AND it disarms a safety check: see
     `test_the_darkfield_flag_has_not_come_back` below.
   * `--no_autotune`. Its name is INVERTED. Upstream declares it
     `action="store_false"`, `default=True`, and gates autotune with
     `if not args.no_autotune:` -- so NOT passing it SKIPS autotune (the intended
     behaviour) and PASSING it ENABLES autotune. A maintainer reading the flag name and
     "helpfully" adding it to turn autotune off would turn it ON.

These assertions could not fail before the module was vendored, so they are falsified by
MUTATION rather than by a literal red-then-green: putting `--darkfield` or
`--no_autotune` back into the `withName: 'BASICPY'` block fails
`test_basicpy_ext_args_carries_no_argument_at_all` and the two flag-specific tests.

    At upstream defaults `get_darkfield` is False: only the multiplicative flatfield is

    the pipeline computes, not how well it computes it.

    IT ALSO DISARMS THE SWAP GUARD, which is the part a maintainer flipping this will not
    expect. `bin/apply_basic_profiles.py:_read_profile_stack` refuses a non-positive
    flatfield, and that single check is what catches a dfp/ffp pair passed the wrong way
    round: at upstream defaults the darkfield is ALL ZEROS, so a swap presents an
    all-zero flatfield and is rejected before any division
    (`tests/test_apply_basic_profiles.py::test_swapping_the_two_profiles_is_caught_at_the_shipped_defaults`
    is explicit that it holds "at the shipped defaults"). Enable darkfield and the
    darkfield is no longer zero, so a swapped pair can present two plausible, strictly
    positive profiles: the correction runs to completion on the wrong arithmetic and
    writes silently wrong pixels instead of failing. Whoever enables `--darkfield` owes a
    replacement guard that does not depend on one profile being zero. Recorded in the
    same terms in `modules/nf-core/basicpy/MIRAGE-NOTES.md`,
