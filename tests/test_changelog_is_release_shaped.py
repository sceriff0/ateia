"""CHANGELOG.md must be shaped like a released project's changelog.

On 2026-09-02 it had TWO sections claiming version 1.0.0: `## [Unreleased]`
(~850 lines, everything that will actually ship) and `## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-29`
(the earlier snapshot), with a link definition for only one of them. A reader
looking up "what is in 1.0.0" would find the older, smaller list.

Four properties, each of which was violated or at risk:

* every `## [X.Y.Z]` heading appears once -- two sections for one version means
  one of them is wrong and nothing says which;
* the version `nextflow.config`'s manifest declares has a section, and that
  section is DATED (a released version is not "Unreleased");
* an `## [Unreleased]` section exists, so the next change has somewhere to go
  without re-opening a released section;
* every version heading has a matching link definition at the foot, so the
  headings on GitHub actually link somewhere.
