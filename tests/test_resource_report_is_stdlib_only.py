"""The resource report runs on the head node, so it may import only the stdlib.

The pipeline entry-point workflow's ``generateResourceReport`` invokes this
script as ``python3 <path>`` from ``workflow.onComplete``. That runs on the
**head node**, under whatever interpreter the operator has, OUTSIDE every
container and with none of the pipeline's pinned dependencies available
(design finding F6). A single
``import matplotlib`` makes the report silently unavailable on every deployment
that does not happen to have it -- and the failure is quiet, because the handler
downgrades every error to a warning so a report problem can never fail a run.

No existing guard covers this file: ``tests/test_container_harmonisation.py``
scans the scripts a process module names, and this script is named by no
process module precisely because it is not a process.

The stdlib set is taken from the interpreter (``sys.stdlib_module_names``) rather
than hand-listed, because a hand-list reports stdlib modules as missing
dependencies -- a guard failing for the wrong reason, which this repo has been
bitten by before.
