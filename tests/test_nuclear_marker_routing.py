"""Static guard: nothing reads `params.nuclear_markers` raw.

`params.nuclear_markers` arrives in three shapes and two of them break SILENTLY, so
`lib/MarkerUtils.groovy`'s `markerList()` is the only sanctioned way to read it:

  ['DAPI','CELLTOX']   nextflow.config / a params file -- the intended shape
  'CELLTOX'            `--nuclear_markers CELLTOX` (nextflow_schema.json permits a
                       string, because an array cannot be given on a command line)
  ['DAPI,CELLTOX']     a params file with the list written as one comma-joined string

This test exists because of a real defect, not a hypothetical one.
`modules/local/convert_image.nf` read the parameter raw and called `.join(' ')` on it.
For the List shape that is correct and every test passed. For the String shape it does
NOT throw: Groovy dispatches `"CELLTOX".join(' ')` to Java's static
`String.join(CharSequence, CharSequence...)` with zero varargs, which returns the EMPTY
string -- so the rendered command carried a bare `--nuclear-markers` and
`bin/convert_image.py`'s `nargs="+"` exited 2, mid-run, with an error naming the wrong
problem. Every test for the string spelling was `-stub`, and `-stub` never evaluates a
`script:` block, so nothing caught it. A static scan does not care which block the code
lives in, which is exactly why this guard is static.

Two rules, both mechanical:

  A. A raw read may never be followed directly by `.` or `[`. That is the defect shape:
     any method call or index on the un-normalised parameter.
  B. Every read must be routed -- passed to `MarkerUtils.`/`CsvUtils.` (whose entry
     points all funnel into `markerList`), on the same line or as an argument line of a
     multi-line call to one of them.
