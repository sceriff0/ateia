"""CITATION.cff must describe the version that actually ships.

CFF is what GitHub renders in the "Cite this repository" panel and what reference
managers import, so a stale field there is a wrong citation in somebody's paper.
On 2026-09-02 it said `date-released: 2026-07-29` (the date of a snapshot, not of
the release) and carried a literal `TODO(release)` marker in place of the DOI.

`version` is checked against `nextflow.config`'s manifest rather than against a
hardcoded string, so the two cannot drift; `release.yml`'s verify-config already
holds the manifest to the git tag, which closes the chain tag -> manifest -> CFF.
