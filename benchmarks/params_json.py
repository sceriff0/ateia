"""Turn a run-plan row into a Nextflow ``-params-file`` with real JSON types.

WHY THIS EXISTS. ``run_sweep.sh`` and ``run_arms.sh`` used to pass every swept
axis as ``--<name> <value>``. **Nextflow 26 delivers every CLI ``--param`` as a
String**, and ``nextflow_schema.json`` declares real types, so the run dies at
``validateParameters()`` before a single task::

    * --reg_qc (1): Value is [string] but should be [integer]
    * --reg_qc (1): Expected any of [[0, 1, 2]]
    * --pyramid_resolutions (4): Value is [string] but should be [integer]

Reproduced 2026-08-25: NXF_VER=25.04.7 accepts the CLI form, 26.04.6 rejects it.
The sweep passes ~40 such axes, so the whole experiment was unlaunchable on the
engine this pipeline is verified on -- and it would have failed at LAUNCH, on the
cluster, after the matrix had already been generated.

A ``-params-file`` carries JSON types, so it survives both engines. It is also
the mechanism ``docs/usage.md`` already prescribes for boolean params, for the
same underlying reason.

WHY IT COERCES FROM THE SCHEMA RATHER THAN GUESSING. "Looks like a number" is
the wrong rule: a param declared ``"type": "string"`` whose value happens to be
``2048`` must stay a string, or validation fails in the other direction. The
schema is the thing being validated against, so it is the thing consulted.
A run-plan column naming no schema param is passed through unchanged and
reported on stderr rather than silently dropped.

Usage::

    python3 -m benchmarks.params_json --out run_params.json reg_qc=1 memory_mode=high
