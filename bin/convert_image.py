    squeezes in ``convert_to_ome_tiff``); they are walked in C order, which is the page
    order tifffile expects for ``shape=``.

    THE ASSUMPTION THIS FUNCTION MAKES EXPLICIT: how much memory the write costs is the
    READER's decision, not this function's. It is bounded by ONE axis-0 chunk of whatever
    the reader handed back -- one plane when the reader chunks per plane (the good case),
    the whole stack when it returns a single chunk.

    So the planes are NOT fetched one index at a time. Doing that is a REGRESSION, not
    merely a missed optimisation: dask does not cache across independent ``compute()``
    calls, so on a single-chunk array ``image_data[i]`` decodes the WHOLE stack, once per
    plane -- same peak as the eager write it replaced, times N the work. Measured on an
    8-plane single-chunk fixture: 8 whole-stack decodes.

    A plain ``.rechunk()`` does not fix that either (measured: still 8 decodes). Rechunking
    splits the graph DOWNSTREAM of the source read, and every plane's ``compute()`` still
    re-reads the source chunk. Iterating in chunk-sized slabs is what actually bounds it,
    and it bounds it at exactly one decode per chunk for every chunking --
    ``tests/test_convert_streaming_write.py::test_a_chunk_is_decoded_once_whatever_the_chunking``
    pins 1/2/8-plane chunks at 8/4/1 decodes.

    Array-likes with no ``chunks`` (the ndarray the NDPI/HDF5 readers return) keep the
    plain per-index walk: there is no decode to amortise, and the caller may only support
    scalar-tuple indexing.

    the moment one is bigger than a single tile. Feeding it ``_iter_planes`` therefore
    only works while a whole plane happens to FIT IN ONE TILE, which is exactly the
    case a small fixture creates -- tifffile pads an undersized item without complaint.
    So the striped-vs-tiled write was covered by a test that could not fail, and the

    This is the second half of the lazy conversion, and it is not optional. Reading via
    ``BioImage.dask_data`` alone saves nothing: the whole-array ``tifffile.imwrite`` call
    this function replaces passes its argument through ``numpy.asarray``, so the slide
    would simply be materialised at the write instead of at the read. (Spelled without
    parentheses on purpose: ``tests/test_slide_io_seam.py`` counts pixel-writing call
    sites by scanning this file's TEXT, and a prose example reads as a second writer.)

    The streaming form is the one ``bin/tiled_stitch.py:156-170`` already uses: hand
    ``TiffWriter.write`` an ITERATOR of pages together with an explicit ``shape=`` and
    ``dtype=``, which it cannot infer from a generator.

    Most other decisions are carried over unchanged from the eager writer this replaces:
    ``bigtiff=True``, ``ome=True``, no compression, and ``photometric="minisblack"`` -- the
    last being the precondition that makes one page equal one channel, which every
    downstream per-page read depends on (see ``tests/test_slide_io_seam.py``). Because of
    those, the PIXELS and the OME-XML header stay identical to the eager writer's --
    ``tests/test_convert_streaming_write.py`` decodes both and compares.

    The one deliberate change is ``tile=(CONVERT_TIFF_TILE, CONVERT_TIFF_TILE)``: the file
    is now TILED rather than striped. See ``CONVERT_TIFF_TILE`` for why -- in short, a
    striped TIFF makes every region read downstream decode a whole plane. Tiling changes
    the on-disk layout (and therefore the raw bytes -- this file is no longer byte-identical
    to the old writer's output, only pixel-and-metadata-identical), not the pixels, which is
    what ``tests/test_convert_streaming_write.py::test_the_write_is_tiled`` pins.

    Peak memory is one axis-0 chunk of ``image_data``, not one plane -- see
    ``_iter_planes``. When those are the same thing this is a per-plane write; when the
    reader returns the stack as a single chunk it is not, and that is warned about rather
    than silently claimed away.
